 * How many videos sit side by side on the home feed and in the "More videos" list of the watch
 * page.
 *
 * The count comes from the width the list actually gets (not from "phone vs tablet"), so a
 * foldable lands on the right layout on both screens: one big card per row on the cover screen
 * (about 350-410 dp wide) and two per row on the unfolded inner screen (about 720-830 dp), even
 * when a navigation rail takes some of that width.
 *
 * Plain Kotlin on purpose (no Compose types) so it can be unit tested.
